Sailfish Python

this is a pyotherside based app template for sailfish os.
i simply cant get my head around the way rpm packages are built,
so i found an alternative Way using fpm 
https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm

these packages are needed to build/install the package:

fpm -- to package a a root tree from a temporary directory to a rpm package
rsync -- to send the package to your testing machine (jolla phone or sailfish emulator)

use these make commands to build/install your app for testing:

make make-virt  
build your package, and install it on your Sailfish Emulator on localhost:2223, considering 
your Sailfish-SDK is installed at ~/SailfishOS

make make-jolla-wifi
build your package, and install it on your jolla phone, considering your development PC is
authorized for root ssh login on the phone and it is found in your dns-space as "jolla"

make make-jolla-usb [jolla_usb_ip=192.168.2.15]
build your package, and install it on your jolla phone, considering your development PC is
authorized for root ssh login on the phone, and connected via usb development mode.
set your jollas ip like above.


Adding dependencies:
a basic set of dependencies are already added to the Makefile, but you can still add other ones
to the list.

Adding python Modules:
all python Modules in pyPackages are included in the package. 
for now, i like to package both an armv7l and a x86 version and select the package version
within the qml code. Packages are built with "noarch", so they should run an any device.
I had success using pip wheel to build these packages directly on the jolla phone/sailfish emulator
and unpacking them to pyPackages.
as an example, the is pillow (Python Imaging Library) included in the package.

Renaming your App:
./renamep.py "my-new-appname"
